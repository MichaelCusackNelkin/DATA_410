# Adv_Applied_ML
This repo holds my data science and machine learning work from DATA 410/advanced applied machine learning at William & Mary. 
This repository is mostly Jupyter Notebooks and HTML files detailing the work done. In the Final project folder is my exploratory final project involving an exploration of using TensorFlow deep learning to build a video classification algorithm. The idea behind this capstone is to eventually spin it off into an app that can be used to identify videos of idling trucks and pull text from the videos. This could be useful to residents in NYC, who can send videos to the city government and receive a portion of any idling-emissions fines. The app could streamline the process of verifying videos and identifying companies to be fined.
